## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is a crucial aspect of JavaScript that allows you to handle tasks such as API calls, file reading, and timers without blocking the execution of other code. In this post, we'll dive into the fundamentals of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, including callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## The Evolution of Async in JavaScript

JavaScript's approach to handling asynchronous operations has evolved over the years. Initially, callbacks were the primary method, but they often led to "callback hell" due to their nested nature. Promises were introduced to address this issue, and later, async/await syntax made asynchronous code even more readable and maintainable.

### Callbacks

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, executed once a task is completed. While they work well for simple tasks, they can become difficult to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data fetched");
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```
