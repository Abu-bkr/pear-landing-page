## Introduction

CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout modules that have revolutionized the way we design responsive websites. While both are incredibly useful, they serve different purposes and have unique strengths. In this post, we'll explore the differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox, and when you should use each one.

## Understanding CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex layouts with rows and columns. It's ideal for grid-based designs where you need precise control over both the horizontal and vertical alignment of elements.

### When to Use CSS Grid

- **Complex Grid Layouts**: If your design involves multi-row and multi-column layouts, CSS Grid is the way to go. It provides a more straightforward and powerful way to create such structures.
- **Full Page Layouts**: CSS Grid is perfect for creating full-page layouts, where you want to define the positioning of headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## Understanding Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that works either in a row or a column. Itâ€™s best suited for distributing space within a container and aligning items in a flexible way.

## When to Use Flexbox

- **Single-Dimensional Layouts**: If your layout is primarily a single row or column, Flexbox is more efficient and easier to implement than CSS Grid.
- **Alignment and Distribution**: Flexbox excels at aligning items along the main axis and distributing space within a container.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```
