At PearAI, we're always looking for ways to support developers in their professional growth. Today, we're introducing our latest feature: the LeetCode Slash Command. This integration brings LeetCode problems directly into your PearAI workspace, offering a streamlined approach to technical interview preparation.

## A Practical Tool for Interview Readiness

The LeetCode Slash Command is designed to complement your existing interview preparation routine. By providing easy access to LeetCode problems within PearAI, it helps you practice more efficiently and consistently.

## How It Works

Using the LeetCode Slash Command is straightforward:

1. **Coding LeetCode Problems in PearAI**:
   You can now solve LeetCode problems directly in PearAI. Create a new file for your solution and start coding as you would in a real interview setting.

2. **PearAI LeetCode Command**:
   Type `/leetcode [LINK_TO_LEETCODE_PROBLEM] @[YOUR_SOLUTION_FILE]`
   This command loads the specified LeetCode problem and links it to your solution file.

3. **Get Helpful Guidance**:
   As you work on the problem, PearAI provides suggestions and hints, similar to what you might experience in an actual interview setting. This helps you improve your problem-solving skills and learn best practices.

## Features to Support Your Preparation

The LeetCode Slash Command includes several useful features:

- **Problem Analysis**: Get insights into the problem structure and potential approaches.
- **Hint System**: Receive gradual hints if you're stuck, encouraging independent problem-solving.
- **Code Review**: Get feedback on your solution's efficiency and style.

## Integrated Practice Environment

By bringing LeetCode problems into PearAI, we've simplified the process of regular coding practice. This integration reduces the need to switch between different platforms, potentially saving you time and maintaining focus.

## A Useful Addition to Your Prep Toolkit

The LeetCode Slash Command is a practical feature aimed at making your interview preparation more convenient and effective. It's not a magic solution, but rather a helpful tool in your overall preparation strategy.

We hope this new feature proves useful in your coding practice and interview preparation. Remember, consistent practice and a solid understanding of fundamental concepts are key to interview success.

Start incorporating the LeetCode Slash Command into your preparation routine, and let us know how it works for you. We're always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.
